# WebVR Projects

Utilizing the [Business Casual](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/business-casual/) theme by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), I have created these hand-ins to showcase my abilities with primarily A-Frame and some web developing.

## Download and Installation

To get these A-frame projects:

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Avalin/Hand_Ins.git`

That's it.

## Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Bugs and Issues

### Hand-In 1:
- Camera has a "boaty" movement
- 3D model shader problems on all animated characters

### Hand-In 2: 
- Camera height at spawn vs camera height when teleporting issue
- Not all Oculus Quest button component registers/works? i.e. I could not make a component for when using the thumbstick
- Sounds not always working on Firefox (Probably an A-frame related issue)

## Copyright and License

Don't use this for commercial purposes. I don't personally care, but Nintendo or Disney might.
